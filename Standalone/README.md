To start on macOS you need to open terminal and do the following

```
chmod a+x

then drag the executable in front and press enter

Right click the file -> Open as -> Terminal
> Be sure to check the always open checkbox to be able do double cick to open the file in the future

Once that is done you can open the Server normally by double clicking it
